// Episode 1

};

}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// Predicted output: "The murderer is Miss Scarlet" because Miss Scarlet was declared as a global variable which the function can call from.

// Episode 2

const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// Predicted output: "error: assignemnt to constant" because the murderer was declared a constant outside the function, therefore it cannot be changed within the function.

// Episode 3

let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();

console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);

// Predicted output: "First Verdict: The murderer is Mrs. Peacock" "Second Verdict: The murderer is Professor Plum" because we used let to declare the variable,
// the murderer can be changed within the function. However, it is only changed within the function, not outside the function.

// Episode 4

let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;

console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);

// Predicted output: "The three suspects are Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard" "Suspect three is Mrs. Peacock" because within the function declareAllSuspects suspect 3 is change,
// when suspects is called it uses the updates suspect 3. However when calling suspect 3 out of the function, it is still Mrs. Peacock.

// Episode 5

const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',

}

const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);

// Predicted output: "The weapon is the Revolver" because even though the weapon is within a constant variable, it is a key within a constant variable which can be changed. 

// Episode 6

let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// Predicted output: "The murderer is Mrs. White" because the global variable was changed in the change murder function, and then within that function the murderer is changed again with a plot twist.

// Episode 7

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// Predicted output: "The murderer is Mr. Green" because the plot twist function assigns the variable with let, that only changes the murderer within the function.
// if it did not include let, then the murderer would be Miss Scarlet

// Episode 8

const scenario = {

}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is ${scenario.weapon}.`
}

changeScenario();
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);

// Predicted output: "The weapon is Candle Stick" because the changeScenario fuction is passing in Mrs. Peacock which then changes the room to dinging room,
//the next function within that is plotTwitch which then passes in dining room and outputs Colonel Mustard, and finally the unexpectedOutcome function
// passes in Colonel Mustard and outputs Candle Stick.

// Episode 9

  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// Predicted output: "The murderer is Professor Plum" because assigning the new murderer using let is only within the scope of the if statement, and not globally.
